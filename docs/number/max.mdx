### Usage

Given an array of items and a function to get the value of each item, returns the item with the largest value. Uses `_.boil` under the hood.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const fish = [
  {
    name: 'Marlin',
    weight: 105,
    source: 'ocean',
  },
  {
    name: 'Bass',
    weight: 8,
    source: 'lake',
  },
  {
    name: 'Trout',
    weight: 13,
    source: 'lake',
  },
]

_.max(fish, f => f.weight) // => {name: "Marlin", weight: 105, source: "ocean"}
```
