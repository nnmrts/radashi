### Usage

Given an array of items, `group` will build up an object where each key is an array of the items that belong in that group. Generally, this can be useful to categorize an array.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const fish = [
  {
    name: 'Marlin',
    source: 'ocean',
  },
  {
    name: 'Bass',
    source: 'lake',
  },
  {
    name: 'Trout',
    source: 'lake',
  },
]

const fishBySource = _.group(fish, f => f.source) // => { ocean: [marlin], lake: [bass, trout] }
```
